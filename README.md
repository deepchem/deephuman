Deep Learning powered models of humans for virtual clinical trials.

Clinical trials remain by far the most expensive part of the medicine discovery process. Creating deep learning powered models of humans could significantly speed up the process of drug discovery by lowering the risk of failures in the clinic.

What technologies could enable better models of human drug response? Part of this will have to include deep-learning models based on clinical data. Others could draw upon the large body of work on human physiology. This repo will serve as a stub to encourage development of new methods.
